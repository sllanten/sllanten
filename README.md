## Description

I consider myself a person with human quality, who assumes with pleasure and responsibility the challenges, in the same way, with initiative to learning.

In the field of programming I like to document and test myself about new functions, programming languages, design patterns among other things.

## Installation of Public Repositories

For proper operation you must have installed:
[Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) v2.3.4 
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/es/) v16.14.2 LTC
[Xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/es/index.html) v7.4.28-1-VC15

Once the repository is copied you must open a terminal and execute the following commands
Note: When the project is in a version below the current one you must run:

```sh
composer require laravel/ui:^2.0 --ignore-platform-reqs <--for laravel 7
php artisan ui vue --auth <--for laravel 7
npm install
npm run dev
```
